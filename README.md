# Code Quiz

## About
This code quiz was designed to test your knowledge on the different aspects of coding. It is a multiple choice quiz and includes questions about HTML, CSS, jQuery, Bootstrap and JavaScript. It will keep track of your local score and you can have multiple attempts to see what highscore you can get!

## Functionality
Upon opening up the [Code Quiz](https://bdjm94.github.io/WebAPI-Code-Quiz/), you are greeted with a welcome message about the code quiz. Upon reading the message, you will learn that you have to answer the questions as fast as you can, but as accurate as each incorrect answer results in a time/score penalty. The quiz starts by hitting the "Start Quiz" button and upon completion, you are able to view your highscores by clicking the "View Highscores" link in the top left corner. There is a timer that keeps track of how long left in the quiz you have, but also will be an indication of your score.
